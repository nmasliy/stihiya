                    This is our world. A warm, cosy place. The signal begins its journey from Yevpatoria using one of the most powerful radio telescopes in the world. Space is not that far. Only some 100 kilometres upwards. An hour by a car. Down there, on Earth, life is in full swing, billions of people are involved in interaction, stock trading does not stop, TV shows are running, people are born, live and die. Human activity, especially over the past 100 years, have significantly changed the face of the Earth. This is also part of the nature. This change, however, must be controlled and accountable. This is how we can save our home.

                    After 1.25 seconds, the signal flies through the orbit of the Moon. A familiar, safe place. The Moon has always amazed us with its appearance and the fact of its existence. There are three currently dominant hypotheses about the origin of the Moon: the Earth and the Moon could have formed together from one protoplanetary cloud; the Moon could be "captured" by the Earth; and the Moon could have formed as a result of a giant collision of the Earth with another celestial body, and this is nowdays the most probable cause. There were also propositions that the Earth had several moons in the past and they subsequently merged into one celestial body, and the Moon could also “leak” out from the Earth in the form of a magmatic clot due to centrifugal force.

NASA's Curiosity rover found only dry lakes on the planet's surface, confirming that the Mars had water in the past. Also, the data gathered by the Marsis radar installed at the Mars Express interplanetary station, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54337779">suggests</a> that there may be a subsurface lake.

                    After just over 15 minutes, the signal reached the asteroid belt, a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. Most likely, the belt is a planet that was never able to form mainly due to the gravitational influence of the Jupiter. Asteroid mining can prove to be crucial for further space exploration. The minerals contained in asteroids are a good source of iron, nickel and titanium. Some asteroids contain water-bearing minerals, that can be used to extract water and oxygen necessary to sustain life, as well as hydrogen - one of the main components of rocket fuel. One of the current interesting candidates is the asteroid 2011 UW/158, which is in close proximity from us and is estimated to contain platinum worth of 300 billion to 5.4 trillion dollars.

It is a dwarf planet, but previously it was considered a planet. With a diameter of about 950 km, Ceres is the largest and most massive body in the asteroid belt. It is larger than satellites of the giant planets and contains almost a third of the total mass of the belt. The analysis of its density suggests that one third of it is made of water ice. In January 2014, Herschel infrared telescope detected clouds of water vapor around Ceres. Thus, Ceres became the fourth celestial body in the Solar System with proven water on its surface (after Earth, Enceladus, and possibly Europa).

The Jupiter is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium and has no solid surface. The most commonly accepted model for Jupiter's structure suggests that it consists of an atmosphere, a layer of metallic hydrogen and a rocky core. It is a big mystery that Jupiter emits more energy than it receives from the Sun. Astronomers speculate that this is due to the gradual gravitational contraction of the planet. The Jupiter also serves as a "springboard" for spacecrafts leaving the Solar System. A gravitational manoeuvre in the vicinity of the planet allows achieving a significant increase in speed and shortening the flight time.

It is a giant ball of gas, but so light it could float on a water. The first person to suggest that the Saturn is surrounded by a ring was Christian Huygens. The famous rings are perhaps the debris of the planet’s destroyed satellite. An incomparable beauty created by destruction. The belt consists of a billion ice floes ranging in size from sugar cubes to the size of a house. Despite the fact that the rings are stretched for millions of kilometres, they are only no more than 10 meters thick. One of the Saturn's most famous landmarks is the Hexagon – a hexagonal vortex on its north pole. No one really understands the nature of this phenomenon. The signal flies through the orbital distance of the Saturn, and from this distance we begin to lose visual contact with the Earth.

Something else must be causing these fierce winds, but no one knows what exactly.

The Pluto has an atmosphere that freezes when away from the Sun, but as Pluto approaches the Sun, the atmosphere begins to evaporate. Due to the peculiarities of its orbit, the <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.eso.org/images/screen/eso0908a.jpg">Pluto</a> can come closer to the Sun than Neptune.

After the discovery of the Kuiper belt, and especially the resonant objects that make the planets migrate, the picture has completely changed. Our solar system no longer fits the neat model that we imagined it before.

But after Pluto was reclassified from ordinary planets to dwarf ones, she lost this chance. Due to the fact that its surface is constantly covered with methane snow, Eris reflects almost 96% of light, making it one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Interestingly, after its discovery, astronomers studied archival photographs and found Eris on many of them. Looks like it could have been discovered back in 1954, if they knew where to look.

This robot was launched in 1977 and has done a huge amount of research during the flight, becoming one of the most successful projects in the history of astronautics. He holds the record for the farthest <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">photograph</a> of the Earth, called the "Pale blue dot" that was taken from a breath-taking distance of more than 6 billion kilometres from Earth. Voyager-1 has a long, if not endless future. Millions of years later, if nothing stops it, it will fly to other stars.

                    The signal flew to a mysterious planet that supposedly exists in the Kuiper belt, beyond the Pluto's orbit. Nobody has seen this planet yet. Astronomers only assume its presence, based on statistical anomalies of the orbits of dwarf planets. There are several hypotheses for its origin, including that Planet 9 is the nucleus of a nascent gas giant that was pushed out by Jupiter in the formation of the Solar System. Some scientists think that Planet 9 is nothing but a tiny black hole 4-5 centimetres in size and with a mass of five Earths. Japanese Subaru telescope at the observatory in Hawaii will be searching for this mysterious planet over the next years.

                    After a year and a half, the signal goes beyond the hypothetical Oort cloud. The Oort cloud is believed to be the remnant of the original protoplanetary disk that formed around the Sun about 4.6 billion years ago and is composed primarily of icy objects. According to various estimates, the Oort cloud contains from several hundred billion to several trillion objects with a radius of 1 kilometre or more. We still cannot observe the cloud, but we can observe the objects of the Oort cloud when they pass relatively close to the Sun in the form of long-period comets (with an orbital period of more than 200 years). Voyager 1 should reach the Oort cloud in 300 years and it will take another 30,000 years to go beyond it.

According to the data received from telescopes, the star has a Jupiter-like planet.

In 2015, astronomers announced that GJ 436b, which is roughly 22 times as massive as Earth, had a huge gas cloud streaming away from it for millions of miles. Follow-up observations announced in 2017 revealed the planet's orbit is also bizarre, as it goes over the star's poles. That's very different from our own solar system, where the planets' orbits gather around the sun's equator.

The radius of the star, determined using interferometry, is approximately 1.73 times the radius of the Sun. There may be a cold debris disk around the star, making Denebola a good candidate for exoplanet searches.
