            <div class="faq__text">
                Stihia is electronic music, arts and science festival. It is an independent project incepted in 2017 in Uzbekistan with an aim to raise awareness about the environmental catastrophe of the Aral Sea. "Stihia" means "force of nature" and it comes from Greek. Festival consists of several projects that involve musicians, DJs, producers, artists and scientists.

            <div class="faq__text">
                We believe that the topic of climate change should be addressed in every possible way however unusual it may be. The project is first of all a result of the great collaboration of astrophysicists, radio astronomers, musicians, producers and enthusiasts. We believe that the signal should be a warning bearer for future generations and, if lucky, also for extraterrestrial civilizations, which, depending on the level of their technological development, are likely to impact their environment in a similar way as we, humans, do.

            <div class="faq__text">
                The signal consists of a combination of sound and graphic elements. The audio part consists of fifteen-second pieces of music and the graphic part consists of the periodic table, dynamic coordinates of stars from Ulugh Beg’s stellar catalogue and a combination of other graphic elements that, with the maximum probability, can be recognized by extraterrestrial intelligence as artificially created. The entire radio message will be encoded and presented in binary code, as the simplest, as we believe, way of perceiving information.

            <div class="faq__text">
                <p>Ulugh Beg was a great scientist, a visionary who lived in Samarkand in 15th century and represented the forefront of the then fundamental science. His observatory was considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time and the largest in Central Asia.</p>
                <p>We are not just sending his stellar catalogue – we are sending coordinates of the stars from his catalogue of 1437 and also the present coordinates of the same stars. This is crucial, as stars have moved in last almost 600 years and by sending the coordinates in dynamics, we can demonstrate to alien civilization that we, humans, are capable of scientific and technological progress.</p>

                <p>These are the tracks from previous and upcoming Stihia line-ups. We also approached Pink Floyd and got OK, because they have a song called “Louder than words”, which is dedicated to the Aral Sea, and also Eduard Artemyev, father of Soviet electronic music, who wrote soundtracks for most of Tarkovskiy’s movies, and has been supporting our festival from day one.</p>
                <p>The selection of acoustic works is carried out by the special jury. Such works should primarily be centered around the issue of a negative impact on climate. We do not know how to express it exactly, but we rely on your talent and taste. Use your imagination.</p>

                Any professional or novice musician from planet Earth can take part in the contest. The main selection criterion is that the work must be your own production and must correlate with your inner voice of calling for environmental protection. Use your imagination. Other requirements for tracks are: 1) duration - no less and no more than 15 seconds, 2) format - wav, 3) genre – preferably electronic, but it also can be anything progressive or catchy, 4) title - give a good punch line, as your heart suggests.

                Sending radio messages into the deep space is always a complex process that required careful administration and technology. Lots of complex regulatory issues must be resolved including on inter-governmental level. It is crucial to pick the right time of the transmission, and this may prove to be very difficult to find the right “window” as radio telescopes are usually heavily booked with interstellar and interplanetary missions. On the top of that, even though radio telescopes are very sophisticated instruments it is difficult to find the one with the right capacities. We are talking about launching a signal of enormous power with the aim of delivering it to its destination in more than 100 light years away from the Earth. These are insanely gigantic distances. Therefore, the signal should be as simplified and focused as possible. That is why the radio message is encoded in binary code, and the sampling rate and PCM coding of is only 8 kilohertz. So, we hope, the signal will be simplified as much as possible for perception and decoding.

                It is all about wavelength, polarization, modulation and transmission power. There is a lot of discussion on this issue among scientists, but based on the distance and on the recommendation of astrophysicists and radio astronomers, the following characteristics were chosen: the wavelength shall have one of the "magic" values, for example 6.72 cm = 21 cm / π, defined as the ratio of two universal constants - physical (radio line of interstellar hydrogen) and mathematical. Polarization - discretely changeable circular and linear polarization for indicating artificial nature of the signal. The power is 150 kilowatts at 60 bits per second. At this power the signal will almost certainly reach distances of over 100 light years.

                We do not know. We are unaware of the level of development of extraterrestrial intelligence, but if there is one, then we believe that there are basic elements in comprehending that can form the basis for deciphering. With the help of very simple examples, such as 1 + 1 = 2 (correct) and 1 + 1 = 3 (incorrect), you can build a whole system of encrypting text that can be decrypted by a mind that is quite possibly different from ours. The main task of the signal is to attract the attention of an extraterrestrial civilization, which then must understand that our message is an artificially created signal, and try to decode it.

            <div class="faq__text">
                It all depends on what is considered to be a success. For musicians, success has already happened. Just imagine, their works will be making an interstellar journey, through cosmic depths for more than 120 years. During this time, every human living now on Earth, will pass away. After an extraterrestrial civilization intercepts our signal, it may try to contact us by sending the same signal back to us. Thus, these works can return to Earth after more than 240 years (or 80 years in case with Trappist-1)! Becoming a part of this story is a tremendous privilege and success for all project participants. From the point of view of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization - the question is extremely difficult. We have no idea what the success rate of such a contact is. Even if our signal is intercepted by an extraterrestrial civilization, then we most likely will not know whether the project has been implemented, since the response time will take much longer than our lives. We hope that the project will be successful, and our descendants will be able to witness this and it will be the greatest event in the history of all mankind.

            <div class="faq__text">
                An exoplanet is a planet that is located outside our solar system. For a long time, detecting planets near other stars remained impossible, since such planets are extremely small and dim in comparison with the stars, and the stars themselves are far from the Sun. The first exoplanets were discovered in the late 1980s. Thanks to improved scientific methods and technology, exoplanets are easier to discover nowadays. As of December 6, 2020, the existence of 4379 exoplanets in 3237 planetary systems has been reliably confirmed, of which 717 has more than one planet. The number of reliable candidates for exoplanets is much larger. Thus, according to the Kepler project, as of January 2020, there were 2,420 more candidates, and according to the TESS project, as of January 2020, 1,082 candidates. The total number of exoplanets in our galaxy is estimated at no less than 100 billion, of which 5 to 20 billion are possibly Earth-like.

            <div class="faq__text">
                <p>Аccording to the confirmed data, today it is most likely that these exoplanets are the only exoplanets that are both in the habitable zone and that have water in the atmosphere. Also, there are three potentially habitable exoplanets in TRAPPIST-1 system, which increase chances of contact with alien civilisation.</p>
                <p>Water in atmosphere is an important factor indicating the presence of water surfance on the exoplanets, and therefore significantly increases the likelihood of life.</p>

            <div class="faq__text">
                The exoplanet lies in the constellation Leo, which is the constellation of the northern hemisphere. It is still impossible to see the exoplanet through a telescope due to the lack of existing facilities. This is how a star looks through a telescope, around which an exoplanet orbits, and this is how K2-18b looks from orbit in the artist's view. K2-18b is expected to be observed with the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2021, and the ARIEL Space Telescope, due to launch in 2028. Both will be telescope instruments designed to determine the composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets.

                People have always looked into the sky in the hope of finding evidence of the existence of another life, and hopefully an intelligent life. Sending a radio message is like sending a note in a bottle into the interstellar ocean. It is difficult to justify such an initiative with arguments other than emotional and ethical considerations of a messianic and altruistic sense. And nevertheless, we should understand one simple thing: if there are only those who “listen” in space, and there is no one who “speaks”, then we are going to end up in complete silence, where any search simply loses its meaning.

            <div class="faq__text">
                The question of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence has disturbed human minds since the Renaissance, with the invention of the telescope by Galileo and the spread of the heliocentric system of the Copernican world. There are 400 billion stars in our galaxy and there are billions of such galaxies in the universe. If every one millionth star had a similar planet, and of these planets at least one of the millions had life, and of these lives, if at least one of the millions had intelligent life, then the universe would be teeming with intelligent civilizations. To this day, however, no one seems to know the answer to this question. If there are aliens, then where are they, asked Enrico Fermi, creating Fermi paradox. In any case, any answer, positive or negative, would plunge humanity into the most powerful crisis since we, humans, began to reason.
