                        <p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. Carl Sagan once said “The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.”</p>
                        <p>Stihia sestival sends a radio transmission into the deep space in search for extraterrestrial civilization and warning about global natural disasters. We are conducting this experiment to amplify the voice of intergenerational responsibility and reflect humanity's innate longing for the great unknown.</p>
                        <p>The radio message consists of musical and graphic elements, including Ulugh Beg’s stellar catalogue and Mendeleev's periodic table. This is also an open call for musicians to participate in this global experiment by sending us their pieces of work. The jury will pick the most suitable works and will include them in the radio message to be sent to the depths of space.</p>

Although most of the signal fade too quickly, some of the signals may be transmitted for enormous distances. All we need is a powerful transmitting system. Also, the Universe is quite a noisy place. Its objects constantly generate signals much more powerful than those generated by us. So how do we reach out to aliens through that noise? And once we reach out to them, how do we make sure that not only do they understand that this is an artificial signal, but also decipher it and understand our language? This is insanely complex linguistic and engineering task. Together with scientists at METI, we are developing a tutorial that will basically give a some kind of “dictionary” that will help to understand our signal.</div>

METI also supports the development of a global network of observatories for optical SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). In addition, METI promotes research on the many factors that influence the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe, with a special emphasis on the last three terms of the Drake Equation: (1) the fraction of life-bearing worlds on which intelligence evolves, (2) the fraction of intelligence-bearing worlds with civilizations having the capacity and motivation for interstellar communication, and (3) the longevity of such civilizations.
